* Prepare main dataset for merging process;

	informat zip $5.;
	* Just keep certain variables;
	set set101
	    mainfldr.Main02;
	* Create a single zip code for georgraphical location comparisons - take patient zip first, account zip
			if patient is not available;
	if patient_zip_code > 0 then zip = strip(put(patient_zip_code,8.));
		else zip = strip(put(account_zip_code,8.));
	* Strip out leading/trailing blanks so as to make double extra sure that all these variables show up as missing if
		they are indeed missing;
	local_health_juris = strip (local_health_juris);
	first_name = strip (first_name);
	last_name = strip (last_name);
	middle_name = strip (middle_name);

	* Drop first names with numbers in them;
	if anydigit (first_name) then first_name = '';

	* For comparison purposes, combine Asian and PI race/enthicity values into one;
	if strip(race_ethnicity) in ("Cambodian","Chinese","Filipino","Guamanian","Hawiian","Hmong","Japanese","Korean","Laotian",
		"Other/Unknown Asian","Pacific Islander","Samoan","Vietnamese","Asian Indian") 
		then race_ethnicity = "Asian/Pacific Islander";
	*if race_ethnicity = "Other" then race_ethnicity = "Unknown"; *Other is a legitimate race/ethnicity category (n=24205 records);
	if race_ethnicity="Multirace" then race_ethnicity="Other";

*	where substr(last_name,1,1) = "Y";

	drop patient_zip_code account_zip_code;
