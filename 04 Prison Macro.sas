* Purpose: 		A macro, used twice in 05 Merging.sas program, that looks
				 for a sign that a person is in a prison (mostly CA state
				 prisons, a few large local jails as well) and fills in 
				 additional information for that prison/jail
				 Account name, account address, and patient address have
				 already been mostly standardized with $prison format - so 
				 ususally do not need to look for variation of addresses;
