* Last updated:	June 11, 2012 by Erin Murray
* Purpose: 		Merge various source datasets into one, then process data - 
					standardize values, recode, etc.
*==============================================================================;


* Merge various data sources together into one dataset - do this in separate data step from data cleaning and 
	reformatting, for reasons of how SAS works;

* Only run sections of code in set statement that correspond to data sources of new data;

data set100;
* Be specific about which variables we want to keep from data sources;
set 
	set000 /*dataset template*/

	set001 (keep = account_address account_city account_name account_zip_code /*Quest data*/
	collection_date data_source date_of_birth laboratory ordering_doctor first_name occupation
	patient_address patient_city patient_zip_code patient_id last_name result_date sex
	test_name result_name order_name result_comment result_value units)

	set003 (keep = account_address account_city account_name account_zip_code episode_date_3 /*AVSS data*/
	census_tract data_source date_of_birth date_of_death date_of_diagnosis date_of_onset diagnosis 
	local_health_juris mmwr_year occupation patient_address patient_city patient_zip_code result_name result_value
	first_name patient_id last_name middle_name race_ethnicity episode_date_1 reporter_type sex ssn episode_date_2)

	set004 (keep = account_address account_city account_name account_zip_code data_source date_of_birth /*SF data*/
	local_health_juris occupation patient_city first_name patient_id last_name race_ethnicity episode_date_1 sex result_name result_value)

	set006 (keep = account_address account_city account_name account_zip_code census_tract data_source /*CalREDIE data*/
	date_of_birth date_of_death date_of_diagnosis date_of_onset diagnosis episode_date_1 episode_date_2 
	episode_date_3 episode_date_4 first_name laboratory last_name local_health_juris middle_name occupation 
	ordering_doctor patient_address patient_city patient_id patient_zip_code race_ethnicity sex ssn result_value result_name result_comment);


* Drop cases that have missing values for all variables - use an array to loop through all numeric and character
	variables, and count how many are not missing - if all character and numeric variables are missing, 
	then delete the case;


array chr(*) _character_;      
array num(*) _numeric_;   

count=0; 

do i = 1 to dim(chr);          
 if not missing(chr(i)) then count+1;
end;                            
do j = 1 to dim(num);           
 if not missing(num(j)) then count+1;     
end;   

if count=0 then delete; 
drop i j count;

run;

proc sort data = set100; by last_name first_name date_of_birth ssn; run;





/*DM 'LOG;CLEAR;OUT;CLEAR';*/

* Main data step where cleaning and reformatting of amalgamated data takes place;

data set101;
	set set100;

* Clean up patient street address information;

if patient_address ne '' then do;

	* Strip out unneeded characters;
	patient_address = upcase(strip(compbl(compress(patient_address,'.,!?>#-"'))));

	* Standardize way PO Box is spelled;
	patient_address = tranwrd (patient_address,'P BOX','PO BOX');
	patient_address = tranwrd (patient_address,'P O BOX','PO BOX');
	patient_address = tranwrd (patient_address,'P O B','PO BOX');

	end;

	if length(patient_address) > 5 then do; 
	if substr(patient_address,1,6) = 'O BOX ' then patient_address = cat ('P',patient_address); 

	* If want to identify homeless and transient individuals then the following code will do that;
	if ((index(patient_address,"HOMEL") or index(patient_address,"HOML") or index(patient_address,"HOMM") or 
	index(patient_address,"OMELESS")) and index(patient_address,"SECUR")=0 and index(patient_address,"HOMELAND")=0)

	index(patient_address,"TRANSC")=0 then homeless='T'; *transient;
	else homeless='';

	* If address not given or missing, then set as blank; 
	* Commented out the code that also sets addresses of homeless and transient patients to missing.
		Of note, the above code identifying homless and transent individuals is MUCH better than the code that has been commented out below.;
	if anydigit(patient_address) = 0 & (index(patient_address,"UNK") > 0 | /*index(patient_address,"HOMELESS") > 0 | */
	index(patient_address,"NO ADDR") > 0 | /*index(patient_address,"TRANSIENT") > 0 | */

	"NOT REPORTED", "NULL"/*, "OMELESS", "TRANSCIENT"*/)) then patient_address = "";	end;

	* Use format to standardize patient city names;
	patient_city = put(strip(patient_city),$cities.); 

	* Deal with short patient addresses - first, one specific instance where a one letter address means
		the Ca Inst for Men prison, then, otherwise, set address as missing;
	if patient_address  = '0' & (patient_city = "CHINO" | patient_zip_code = 91710 | account_city = "CHINO" | 
		account_zip_code = 91710) then patient_address = "14901 S CENTRAL AVE";
	if length(patient_address) < 3 then patient_address = "";

	end;

* Do single recode needed for account address po boxes (the recodes above were for patient address);
	account_address = tranwrd (account_address,'P.O. BOX','PO BOX');
* Compress out extra spaces and punctuation;
	account_address = upcase(trim(compbl(compress(account_address,'.,!?>#-"'))));

if substr(account_address,1,12) = "ADDRESS:____" then account_address = "";

if account_zip_code = 99999 then account_zip_code = .;
if patient_zip_code = 99999 then patient_zip_code = .;


* Deal with patient city values that are effectively missing, because length of city name is one or two characters;
if (length(patient_city) < 3 & length(patient_city) > 0) then do;
		* First, try to figure out from patient zip;

		else if account_zip_code ne . then patient_city = put (account_zip_code,cityzip.);
		* If all else fails, just set as missing;
		else patient_city = '';
	end;

* Clean up sex values;
* Recode 'other' as 'transgender';
if sex = 'O' then sex = 'T';
* All unstandard values recoded to 'unknown';
if sex not in ('M','F','T','U') then sex = 'U';

if data_source ne "AVSS" then episode_date_3 = .;


* Standardize uppercase for name variables - also compress out numbers and characters;
first_name = compbl(strip(translate(upcase(first_name),' ',"01234567890,-;()?.'`%#[]~/\")));
middle_name = compbl(strip(translate(upcase(middle_name),' ',"01234567890,-;()?.'`%#[]~/\")));

* If "CDC" is part of first name, then assign prisoner status, and strip that part of the name out;
